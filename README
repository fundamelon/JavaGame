no seriously read me
ha ha. why won't the game launch?
also could you put a brief description of the variables here? and a list of links to the articles, just 
to keep everything in one place, to be honest im kinda lost.. 

ok, well upon further study is my lack of coherence to your variables and design, so actually just more comments would be helpful or a list of accessors i can use to get various items, because in real life class design is separate, and i think i would be able to program more efficiently with info hiding, and at the end we could just explain our classes to each other. So anyways I figured out our level design problem, and once I know the accessors as well as a basic idea of your other classes and how I should interact with them, I shall implement with a blocking class as part of it. for your reference here is the article.. enjoy Florida/swampy hell old people land.
